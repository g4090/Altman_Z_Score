#Altman Z-Score Corporate Default Prediction Model
Project Overview

This project involves the development of a corporate default prediction model using the Altman Z-Score formula. The goal of this model is to assess the financial health of companies and forecast their likelihood of default. By calculating the Z-Score, the model classifies companies into three default risk categories: High, Gray Zone, and Low. This project uses synthetic financial data and is implemented in Python using popular libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn for data manipulation, calculations, and visualization.

Goal & Objectives
Goal:

To build a model that predicts the probability of corporate defaults based on financial ratios, using the Altman Z-Score formula.

Objectives:

Data Collection & Preparation:

Create a synthetic dataset containing the financial data of multiple companies.

Include key metrics such as Working Capital, EBIT, Retained Earnings, Sales, etc., necessary for calculating the Z-Score.

Z-Score Calculation:

Implement the Altman Z-Score formula:

ùëç = 1.2√óX1 ‚Äã+ 1.4√óX2‚Äã + 3.3√óX3 ‚Äã+ 0.6√óX4 ‚Äã+ 1.0√óX5‚Äã

where:
X1 = Working Capital / Total Assets
X2 = Retained Earnings / Total Assets
X3 = EBIT / Total Assets
X4 = Market Value of Equity / Total Liabilities
X5 = Sales / Total Assets
Default Risk Classification:
Based on the Z-Score, classify companies into three default categories:
High Default Probability (Z < 1.81)
Gray Zone (1.81 ‚â§ Z ‚â§ 2.99)
Low Default Probability (Z > 2.99)

Visualization:

Generate meaningful visualizations (bar charts, pie charts) to display the Z-Scores and the distribution of default probabilities across companies.
Data Used
The dataset used in this project contains synthetic financial data for 10 companies, including the following key metrics:
Working Capital / Total Assets
Retained Earnings / Total Assets
EBIT / Total Assets
Market Value of Equity / Total Liabilities
Sales / Total Assets
These financial ratios were used to calculate the Altman Z-Score for each company and classify them into High, Gray Zone, or Low risk categories based on the Z-Score thresholds.
Libraries Used
This project is built using the following Python libraries:
pandas: For data manipulation and handling.
numpy: For numerical operations, such as calculations of financial ratios.
matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
seaborn: For enhanced visualizations, built on top of matplotlib.
Key Findings
Z-Score Calculation:
The Z-Score was successfully calculated using the financial ratios. The Z-Score is a key indicator of corporate default risk, with lower scores indicating a higher likelihood of default.
Default Risk Classification:
Companies were classified into three categories:
High Default Probability (Z < 1.81)
Gray Zone (1.81 ‚â§ Z ‚â§ 2.99)
Low Default Probability (Z > 2.99)
Data Visualization:
Z-Score Bar Chart: A bar plot was created to visually compare the Z-Scores of each company.
Default Probability Pie Chart: A pie chart was created to show the distribution of companies in the High, Gray Zone, and Low default categories.
How to Use the Model
To use this model:
Clone or Download the Repository: Clone or download the project files.
Run the Notebook: Open the notebook in Google Colab or any Python environment that supports Jupyter notebooks.
Data: The synthetic financial data is already included in the notebook, but you can replace it with real-world data for more accurate predictions.

Visualization: Once the model runs, the results will be displayed as Z-Scores for each company and the corresponding default probability classification.
Next Steps and Improvements
While this model provides a basic framework for assessing corporate default risk, further enhancements could include:
Real-time data integration: Incorporating real-time financial data via APIs (e.g., from financial data providers).
Backtesting: Evaluating the model using historical data to test its predictive accuracy.

Industry-Specific Adjustments: Customizing the model to include industry-specific factors for more precise predictions.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how the Altman Z-Score can be implemented in Python to predict corporate defaults. By assessing a company's financial ratios, the model offers valuable insights into its default risk, helping analysts, investors, and risk managers make informed decisions.
